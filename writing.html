								<p>Interactive Narrative HTML Story</p>
								<p>Loading... is an interactive story where your choices determine your ending. Without spoiling too much, it's set in the not-so-distant future where you must uncover what this computer holds about the past and for the future. I wrote this piece since I was inspired by Adam Cadre and his Interactive Fiction piece, Varicella. If you haven't played it, I highly recommend you do. From it I draw inspiration for the voice, speed, and focalization of my own piece.</p>

								<h2>Last Book of the Law</h2>
								<p>A creative writing piece in which I take a chapter from a book I am particularly fond of, here it is "A Little History of Philosophy" by Nigel Warburton, and rewrite it through its own language. One of my favorite writing exercises as I am able to expand on intriguing ideas using the chapter's orginial prose. I've always been interested in notions of memory, time, and story-telling as eloquently summed up in this quote from Tom Stoppard, “We cross our bridges when we come to them and burn them behind us, with nothing to show for our progress except a memory of the smell of smoke, and a presumption that once our eyes watered.”  </p>

								<!-- <h2>Inexhaustible Voice</h2>
								<p>"I am a writer becuase I am a human first." The one and only creative video I've put together, and while it is not finished I don't think I can ever go back to it. Because this video was created out of my own heart, which has grown and changed since then, but I love it as a small time capsule of how I saw the world and I felt I was seen. Title and quotes of the video are by William Faulkner.</p>

								<h2>Memory Believing Before Knowing Remembers</h2>  
                                <p>A sonnet about my favorite summer pasttime, lying on the grass outside my house<span id="dots">...</span></p>
									  
									  <span id="more"><pre>
	It is of chaos and confusion here
	Ne’er sun so loud, or sphere so farce as she
	To whom who watches be the quiet seer
	As warmth ensues; the heart will course to beat
	Find pulled lightness from faint and unclear mind
	Brought forth elated calm in nature’s rest
	How to compare the chirp and buzz entwined,
	Or slight breath of a summer's wind to test
	Where is creation once this place hath set
	It was hidden, do you see it so far?
	The uncover’d world from above calls a bet
	To try to fall into the blue noir
	And the tinge of sorrow from being a part
