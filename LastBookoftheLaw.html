								<h2>Last Book of the Law</h2>
								<p>A Rewriting of the Last Chapter of Deuteronomy from "A Little History of Philosophy"</p>
<pre>
            Time is like an old love. Forgetful, bored, nostalgic, 
    reappearing, growing old, going away. Driving into a melancholy, 
    a depression, of the shortcomings before the human heart. But
    ultimately it impresses upon the soul a longing a life cannot do 
        without.

        Of course that is not every story, but that is the thing 
    about them: made up from what people will. A way of explaining 
    the universe while leaving the universe unexplained, it’s a way 
    of keeping it all alive, not boxing it into time. Like a string 
    full of knots, there really is no end until 
        the End. 
    
        So the past, because it is the past, is only malleable 
    where once it was flexible. Once it could change its mind, now it 
    can only undergo change. No limits to human endeavor, to human spirit, 
    to human love while the same goes for atrocity. 
    
        Admire the 
    overwhelming adversity, and yes cry a little, rough up. Reality a bit 
    more. Just as messy, passionate, and mad as history. Claw it, chew it, 
    rearrange it and at bedtime it’s still a ball of string full of knots. 
        Nobody should mind. 
    
        Celebrate the storytelling which is no different from history 
    or fact. The wholeness of the past is a fragile thing. We write 
    it down, re-enact it, frame it, videotape it, dream it. But 
    each an every time with the intention to fit it, force it, 
    function it, to suck out the spirit until it looks the way you 
    think it should. We are all historians in our small way. 
    
    And in 
    some ghastly way have all rewritten our own lives, depriving 
    ourselves of feeling once felt, thoughts once thought, dreams once 
    dreamt. 

    I have the proof. 
    
        It’s in my closet. On the third shelf sits a memory box 
    where my past chose what to safekeep and what to throw away. 
    Wiped out, maps thrown away, everything gone. 
    
        No documents. Nothing. A brave new world for the current 
    self. Flesh will burn, photos will burn, and memory, what is 
    that? The imperfect ramblings of fools who will not see the 
    need to forget. And if we can’t dispose of it we can alter 
    it. After all, human memory is a fickle thing. Tell me why I 
    go to bed angry, but the morning never lets me hold on to 
    tightness in my chest because sleep washes, all. reservations. 
        clean. 
    
        Then again, anger is a tiny emotion. It doesn’t do much to 
    impress upon the soul. Grief, hope, guilt, peace, however, have 
    an insatiable capacity to maintain an iron grip on the heart. But the 
    curious can be similar to the persevering: always in some danger. 
    If you are curious, you might never come home. History has now 
    decided otherwise. Curious people who are explorers must bring back 
    more than a memory or a story, they must bring home potatoes or tobacco 
    or, best of all, gold.
    
    Learning to appreciate the truth in tradition and 
    virtue in change. All experience is sacred. Events named by 
    unassailable knowledge. 
    
    God saw it. God knows. But I am not God. And so when someone 
    tells me what they heard or saw, 
        I believe them, 
            and I believe their friend who also saw, 
        and I believe because I am not God

    but I yearn to do the same; to hear and to see and to sew these 
    accounts together into tapestry of my own history.
