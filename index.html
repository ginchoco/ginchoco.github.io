								<h2>About</h2>
								</header>
							<p>I’m interested in how today’s technologists can design with more intention, creativity, and inclusion. This past winter, I explored the intersection of technology and social good at the Impact Fellowship and I’ve become very focused on how I can design software that is intended to connect and uplift its users. Creativity, because I want to consistently ask the unanswered questions and surround myself with others who think differently.</p> 
							<p>But most of all, I hope to work on my technical and interpersonal skills with the focus of inclusion. We as a society have to desire, above all, to design and create for people who are from marginalized and underrepresented groups. We have to always keep in mind about how we can design products for people who live and need services in different ways than ourselves.</p>
